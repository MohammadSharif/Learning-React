# Learning Redux

Redux is a tool that was made to help write web apps that have consistent behavior, can run in different environments, and are pretty simple when it comes to testing.

Redux doesn't have to be used with React, it can be used with any of the other similar libraries and takes up a extremely small amount of space.

### Installation

Assuming npm is installed on the machine, redux is a simple install with the following command.

```
npm install --save redux
```

#### Useful Extras

Most likely the React bindings and the developer tools will also be needed and can be installed as follows:

```
npm install --save react-redux
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools
```
